             <b>complete railings and gateways of the Buddhist stupa from Bharhut</b>.
              The Bharhut panels are unique in that they are properly labelled in the 
              Brahmi script. A copy of <b> Lion Capital of Ashoka from an Ashoka pillar
              </b> whose four-lion symbol became the official emblem of the Republic of
               India, fossil skeletons of prehistoric animals, an art collection, rare 
               antiques, and a collection of meteorites.The Indian Museum is also regarded
                as the beginning of a significant epoch initiating the socio-cultural and 
                scientific achievements of the country. It is otherwise considered as the 
                beginning of the modernity and the end of <b>medieval era</b>.
